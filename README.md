# react_quickstart

a simple example of getting started with
[`React`](http://facebook.github.io/react/) +
[`react-router`](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) +
[`webpack`](http://webpack.github.io/)


## Usage

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd <this-repo>
npm install
./script/dev
```

The last line runs `http-server` and the `webpack` build
